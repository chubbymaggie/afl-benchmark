# For comparison:
# AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6274 => ~11,100 executions per second
# That's a 16-core CPU @ 2.2GHz running 16 instances of AFL

# AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 6386 SE => ~13,700 executions per second
# That's a 16-core CPU @ 2.8GHz running 16 instances of AFL

# Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5600U CPU => ~4,250 executions per second
# That's a 2 physical core/4 logical core CPU @ 2.60GHz running 4 instances fo AFL

# Quad-CPU Operton(TM) Processor 6276 = ~34,000 executions per second
# This is a computer with four 16-core CPUs running @ 2.3GHz, 64 instancs of AFL
