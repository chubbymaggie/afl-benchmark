# It might throw errors about the kernel throttling the CPU.
# If it does, it'll tell you have to fix in.
# Once everything is fixed and you are sure AFL is working
# properly, we're finally ready to do the benchmarking!

# If you start the benchmark over, remember to clean out the

# For comparison:

# AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6274 => ~10,700 executions per second
# That's a 16-core CPU @ 2.2GHz running 16 instances of AFL

# Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5600U CPU => ~4,250 executions per second
# That's a 2 physical core/4 logical core CPU @ 2.60GHz running 4 instances fo AFL
